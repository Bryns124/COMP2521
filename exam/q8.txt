Question 8

Which of the given statements about tries (A, B, C or D) is false?
Briefly explain why the statement you selected is false.

C is false. This is because the child of the root node could be 
any letter and that trie could end there which would not form a 
complete word or it could go on and have something like 'd' then
'e' and just end there, which would still be an incomplete or 
invalid word.
