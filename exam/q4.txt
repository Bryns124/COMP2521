Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.

Kruskal's was used to make the minimum spanning tree. First of all,
it cannot be Depth-First Search or Dijkstra as those are used to 
find the shortest paths rather than building a spanning tree so they
can be eliminated. Kruskal's can be judged by the addition of the C-D 
edge. This is because, if it was Prim's, after adding A-E, it would 
the options of edges next to A and edges next to E and C-D is not one
of those edges. Thus, it must be Kruskal's.
