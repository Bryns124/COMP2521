Question 7

(a) How many items are examined in searching for the key 42? Justify
    your answer.

Inserting the key as 42, the modulus would be 9. In the index 9,
There is already the value 20. Thus, we only search through 1 
item when searching for the key 42.

(b) How many items are examined in searching for the key 111? Justify
    your answer.

Inserting the key as 111, the modulus would be 1. In the index 1,
There is no item in there. Thus, we search through no items when
searching for the key 111.

(c) What is the worst-case search cost after N total items have been
    inserted? Justify your answer.

Worst case is O(n). This is because the worst case would be every
slot in the array already pointing to an item which would mean that
after hashing the key, it would have to go over all the whole array
to find a slot that is not already pointing to a key.
