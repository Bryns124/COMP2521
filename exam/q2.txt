Question 2

Explain why the compilation error occurred and briefly describe how it
can be fixed.

It is likely that the struct graph was not declared properly in the 
graph.h file. This can be inferred as the graph.c file compiled fine 
and the error occurred after the compilation of the .c file meaning 
the error must be in the .h file. As well as that, this error commonly
occurs when the "struct graph" is not declared properly or not declared
at all, as seen in:
