Question 1

(a) What is the maximum input size that can be processed? Justify your
    answer.

The maximum input size that can be processed in a day would be 
= 2^10000 inputs. This is because the program is stated to be able to
run 1000 times faster and since we are given the same time frame (1 day)
and the same implementation, the number of maximum input size must be
2^(10*1000) = 2^10000 inputs. 


(b) Which of the two algorithms is more efficient? Justify your answer.

Binary search is more efficient than quad search as there is an increase 
in the number of comparisons in quad search. This means that the 
reduction in the number of iterations in the quad search is not able to 
compensate for the increase in comparisons. Therefore, the binary search
is more efficient than the quad search.


(c) What are the time complexities of fnA() and fnB() in terms of a and
    b? Justify your answer.

fnA() is O(b).
fnB() is O(a + b).
